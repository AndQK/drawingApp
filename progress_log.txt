I just started my project (15.3.2022) because I had lots of other school work to do.
I have created a first version of my GUI. It has different buttons and two drop-down lists.
The GUI looks good, but I will upgrade it eventually. The next step is to decide what component I will use for the graphics,
is it canvas or something else. Starting the project and making the first version of my GUI took me about 3-4 hours.

30.3.2022:
Now my GUI works and looks like it suppose to look. Every method that I have coded works so far.
I changed a few things in my GUI-object for example added a box panel so that it is easier to
place the gui components in the right places.
Latest update was fixing DrawSpace class so that now it is possible to see changes on the image.
Next step is to add all additional methods for changing the colours and drawing the shapes.
I think I'm progressing just fine, and eventually I will finish my project in time. So far
my schedule hasn't been the same as I planned it to be. Creating and fixing DrawSpace class took me around 8 hours.
The most challenging and time-consuming thing was to figure out what was wrong with the class, and it took me around 4 to 5 hours to fix it.
Also changing the appearance of the GUI took me some time. Maybe 1 to 2 hours.

Now my drawSpace can draw different shapes for example rectangles, circles, ellipses and lines. This part took me about 12 to 15 hours because I had some difficulties with the implementation.
On the first try my program drew lines which consisted of shapes, in other words when I tried to draw a circle my program drew a line of different sized circles or other shapes.
So I had to change the structure of DrawSpace class by extending it to mouseListener and mouseMotionListener. This helped me to write a bit better mouseDragged and mouseReleased methods.
With the new structure it was easier to separate implementation for pen method from line, circle and rectangle methods. I also created a new class shape because I realised that it is good addition for the
structure of drawSpace, and it is important for storing and loading the imformation of the previously drawn image. It is important for undo- and redo-methods as well.
DrawSpace class has still some bugs that I planned to fix as soon as possible before the deadline.
In addtion, I added a feature that enables us to see a preview of the shape we want to draw. It doesn't work perfectly yet, so I need to add some minor changes to it. All in all, this whole thing took me about 25 hours.
Also, I'm running behind schedule but not much.
