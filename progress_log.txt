I just started my project (15.3.2022) because I had lots of other school work to do.
I have created a first version of my GUI. It has different buttons and two drop-down lists.
The GUI looks good, but I will upgrade it eventually. The next step is to decide what component I will use for the graphics,
is it canvas or something else. Starting the project and making the first version of my GUI took me about 3-4 hours.

30.3.2022:
Now my GUI works and looks like it suppose to look. Every method that I have coded works so far.
I changed a few things in my GUI-object for example added a box panel so that it is easier to
place the gui components in the right places.
Latest update was fixing DrawSpace class so that now it is possible to see changes on the image.
Next step is to add all additional methods for changing the colours and drawing the shapes.
I think I'm progressing just fine, and eventually I will finish my project in time. So far
my schedule hasn't been the same as I planned it to be. Creating and fixing DrawSpace class took me around 8 hours.
The most challenging and time-consuming thing was to figure out what was wrong with the class, and it took me around 4 to 5 hours fix it.
Also changing the appearance of the GUI took some time. Maybe 1 to 2 hours.
